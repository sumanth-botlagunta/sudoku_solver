# Sudoku Solver

The Sudoku Solver project provides a Python-based solution for solving Sudoku puzzles with ease and efficiency. Below, we explain the key points related to using and understanding this project:

- **Python Version**: Ensure that you have Python 3.10 or a higher version installed on your system to run this project successfully.

- **Downloading and Cloning**: You can acquire the project by either downloading it as a ZIP file or by cloning the repository to your local machine using Git.

### Running the Project

1. **Solving Sudoku Puzzles**:

   - Execute the Sudoku Solver by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt within the project directory:

     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```

   - This command will execute the solver using the Sudoku puzzles provided in the `main.py` file by default.

2. **Running Test Cases (Optional)**:

   - To ensure the correctness of the Sudoku solver, this project includes unit test cases that you can run using the following command:

     ```bash
     python -m unittest tests/test_sudoku.py
     ```

   - These test cases validate the solver's functionality, ensuring that it can correctly solve Sudoku puzzles and handle different scenarios.

## Explanation:

The Sudoku Solver employs a backtracking algorithm to efficiently solve Sudoku puzzles. Here's a brief overview of how it works:

- **Backtracking Algorithm**: The solver utilizes a backtracking algorithm, a common technique for solving Sudoku puzzles.

- **Recursive Approach**: It recursively explores possible solutions while adhering to Sudoku rules. The algorithm incrementally fills cells with numbers, backtracks when necessary, and continues until a valid solution is found.

- **Custom Puzzles**: You can easily use your own Sudoku puzzles by replacing the sample puzzles in the `main.py` file with your desired input.

The project aims to provide a clear and straightforward way to solve Sudoku puzzles, making it suitable for both learning and practical use. Happy Sudoku solving!
